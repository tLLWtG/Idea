A functional recreation of the experiment developed by Tetsuro Matsuzawa as a part of his Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis and demonstrated in [this free Mind Field episode on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0).

Essentially it argues that Chimpanzees have a photographic memory and are able to complete tasks adult humans can't. The hypothesis of why humans struggle is that we traded the ability for our complex language skills. For example, they can beat level 9 of this game with only half a second to memorize the layout.

A big problem I had with the experiment as presented was that the chimpanzees obviously had a lot of practice, while the adult was new to the game. Nothing was mentioned about the effect practice would have, so I wanted to build a similar game myself to see how well I could do!

Initially I was pretty slow at level 6 and couldn't complete level 7. With just an hour of practice I was able to beat level 9. I realized that for levels 3-6 all I have to do is look for tile 1 and by the time I tap it, my brain has taken a snapshot of the other numbers and I can quickly complete the level without even thinking about it. Unfortunately I haven't quite gotten to that level of autonomy on levels 7-9, but can still do them with barely any deliberate memorization. My current best times are as follows (Memorize Time / Recall Time / Total Time):

```
Level 3:   0.47s / 0.29s / 0.76s
Level 4:   0.63s / 0.43s / 1.05s
Level 5:   0.58s / 0.72s / 1.30s
Level 6:   0.72s / 0.83s / 1.55s
Level 7:   1.10s / 1.06s / 2.16s
Level 8:   1.50s / 1.89s / 3.39s
Level 9:   1.90s / 1.96s / 3.86s
```

I'm not at the chimps' level but I'm getting there. I'd love to see your times in a comment!
